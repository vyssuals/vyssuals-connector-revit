# Vyssuals Connector Revit
This is the connector that sends data from Revit via WebSocket connection to [Vyssuals.com](https://vyssuals.com). It tries to connect to an existing [vyssuals-websocket-server](https://github.com/vyssuals/vyssuals-websocket-server). If it does not find one, it spins up one itself and connects to it.
